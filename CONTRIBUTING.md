## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable, edition 2024)
- [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) (dependency auditing)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (optional, for local hooks)

## Development Setup

cd sonic-bridge-mcp
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Code Quality

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

```bash
# Formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Linting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Tests
cargo test

# Dependency audit (if deny.toml exists)
cargo deny check
```

## Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

| Prefix     | Usage                          |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| `feat:`    | New feature                    |
| `fix:`     | Bug fix                        |
| `docs:`    | Documentation only             |
| `refactor:`| Code change (no feature/fix)   |
| `test:`    | Adding or updating tests       |
| `ci:`      | CI/CD changes                  |
| `deps:`    | Dependency updates             |
| `chore:`   | Maintenance tasks              |

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with clear, atomic commits
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Open a PR using the provided template
5. Wait for review — we aim to respond within 48 hours

## Release Process

Releases are automated via CI. When a version tag (`v*`) is pushed:

1. CI builds binaries for all supported platforms
2. Packages (.deb, .rpm, .pkg.tar.zst) are created
3. GitHub Release is published
4. Crates.io, Docker Hub, AUR, Homebrew, and Scoop are updated

To create a release:
```bash
# Bump version in Cargo.toml
cargo release patch  # or minor, major
git tag v0.x.y
git push origin v0.x.y
```
